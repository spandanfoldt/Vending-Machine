# Vending-Machine
This project implements a digital vending machine controller using Verilog HDL, designed as a clean and modular Finite State Machine (FSM). The machine supports five different products, accepts coin input, handles online payment, manages cancel operations, calculates change, and generates a dispense signal when payment conditions are met.
